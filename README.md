# DND Generator
This is a simple node js app that acts as a static file server for basic html.
It will also allow for nodejs handlers that can be used as a back-end for front-end to generate content.

### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/randy5235/dnd_generator
cd dnd_generator
npm install
npm run serve
```

This should start the server locally on port 3000.
